		<center id="h1">HOW TO PLAY TAROT:</center>

			  	<br><br><br><br>

				<div id= "h2">Begin by shuffling the deck while contemplating your question. You may want to cut your shuffled deck into three piles and then reassemble it before pulling your cards, or you may not — do what feels right. Likewise, you may want to spread the cards out face down and move them around before picking, rather than splitting the deck. How you shuffle is entirely up to you — the most important aspect is your unwavering concentration on the question you want answered.<br><br><br>

				Pull three cards off the top of the deck, and position them to be read from left to right. This spread may seem simple, but it's also very versatile. You can use the cards to denote past, present, and future, or, situation, action, and outcome. If you're doing a relationship reading, you can even designate the first card as yourself, the second as your partner (or potential partner), and the third as the relationship between you both. Just don't change the parameters of the inquiry mid-reading!

				<br><br><br>

				Don't worry if you don't know the meanings of all the cards yet — there are 78 of them, after all. A big part of reading the Tarot is building up your own intuition. Master the keywords associated with each card — use your booklet or the web for reference — and remember that the illustrations are there for a reason, and likely a factor that drew you to your deck! Look at the cards closely, notice how they relate to one another — look for connections; They should tell a story. Most importantly, don't worry about perfection. Time, practice, and an open mind will serve you well on this journey.

				<br><br><br>

				Now, press pause your research, shuffle your deck, and pull a three-card spread. You're well on your way to reading the Tarot like a true seer.
